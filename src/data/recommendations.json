    "original_title": "Hocus Pocus",
    "overview": "Hocus Pocus is a classic Halloween movie that has captivated audiences since its release in 1993. The movie is set against the enchanting backdrop of Salem, with cobblestone streets, supernatural cemeteries, and misty forests, perfectly capturing the spooky but whimsical spirit of Halloween. The Sanderson sister's eccentric personalities and humurous antics provide much of the movie's humor. Bette Midler shines as Winifred, the ringleader of the sisters, and her over-the-top performance is both intimidating and laugh-out-loud funny. The film also features memorable musical moments, especially Midler's iconic rendition of “I Put a Spell on You,” which has become a Halloween staple. I recommend Hocus Pocus because it balances lighthearted fun with just the right amount of spooky atmosphere, making it a perfect family-friendly Halloween film. Its charm lies in the Sanderson sisters' comedic chemistry, the movie's timeless humor, and the heartwarming message about friendship and bravery. It's a nostalgic, feel-good movie that appeals to all ages, and it's easy to see why it remains a Halloween favorite for many families and viewers who enjoy a fun seasonal scare without anything too frightening.",

    "overview": "This is one of my favorite films to watch because of Tim Burton's aesthetic. His aesthetic has inspired many writers and directors. It starts with Victor, a young man about to marry Victoria. While practicing his wedding vows in the woods, he accidentally proposes to Emily, a mysterious dead woman, and is taken to the land of the dead.

One day, a little girl accidentally enters their world, causing chaos since humans are believed to be dangerous.

    "original_title": "Coraline",
    "overview": "I really recommend watching Coraline. It's an animated fantasy movie directed by Henry Selick, based on the book by Neil Gaiman. Released in 2009, the movie follows Coraline, a young girl who finds a hidden door in her new home. This door leads her to a mysterious alternate world that seems perfect at first, but things soon take a dark turn. The movie is very engaging, with a mix of adventure and a bit of suspense. It's a great choice for practicing English because the language is clear, and the plot is easy to follow. Even if you're not yet fluent in English, the story is simple enough, and you'll pick up some useful words along the way. Coraline is definitely worth watching for its unique story, beautiful animation, and interesting characters. It has a great message about courage, family, and learning to appreciate what you have. Plus, it's enjoyable for both kids and adults. If you like fantasy and mystery, Coraline is a perfect movie to watch!",

    "original_title": "Ghostbusters",
    "overview": "I recommend this movie because it's a classic that, even though it's not considered a horror movie, it has a funny supernatural plot that continues with a less classic saga of 2 more movies (maybe 3 because it was being talked about a new movie). If you're not a fan of horror like me, this is a calm and nice approach to halloween. After Columbia University parapsychology professors Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler experience their first encounter with a ghost at the New York Public Library, the university dean dismisses the credibility of their paranormal-focused research and fires them. The trio responds by establishing 'Ghostbusters', a paranormal investigation and elimination service operating out of a disused firehouse. They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow. Following a paranormal encounter in her apartment, cellist Dana Barrett visits the Ghostbusters. She recounts witnessing a demonic dog-like creature in her refrigerator utter a single word: 'Zuul'. Ray and Egon researched Zuul and details of Dana's building while Peter inspects her apartment and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her. The Ghostbusters are hired to remove a gluttonous ghost from the Sedgewick Hotel.",

It has a very violent and extreme plot. Therefore, it's a perfect movie for Halloween day. SAW follows the story of a murderer called 'Jigsaw'. He captures his victims and puts them in extreme situations, confronting their own fears and sins to survive. He achieves this by using clues they must solve to escape.",

    "overview": "Child's Play (also known colloquially as Chucky) is an American slasher media franchise created by Don Mancini. The films mainly focus on Chucky, a notorious serial killer who frequently escapes death by performing a voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into a 'Good Guy' doll. In my opinion, the franchise is a collection of quite entertaining and creepy classics. The old movies presented a very advanced technology for its time when speaking of Chucky's puppet design. Over the years, the franchise's different movies haven't stopped scaring me, and I really recommend them as a great thrill.",

    "overview": "In my opinion, the movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very good classic horror movie. Why is it so good? Simply because it demonstrated that with a small budget, a lot can be achieved. It's about a group of friends (Sally, Jerry, Pam, Kirk, and Sally's paraplegic brother Franklin) traveling through Texas. They stop at an old house and meet a strange, dangerous family. One of them, called Leatherface, chases them with a chainsaw. The movie is scary because it feels real, with simple effects and a dark, tense mood. How will it continue?",

    "overview": "My favourite movie is: The Blair Witch Project. It follows three film students—Heather, Mike, and Josh—who venture into the Black Hills forest of Maryland to make a documentary about the local legend of the Blair Witch. The witch is rumored to haunt the woods, and stories of her terrorizing presence stretch back to the 18th century. As they get deeper into the forest, the group encounters eerie signs: strange stick figures hanging from trees, rock piles, and unsettling noises at night. As tension rises, the group becomes hopelessly lost, with the ever-present fear of the witch building and driving them to paranoia. It's a chilling film, made with a minimal budget, that uses the found-footage style of filmmaking to create a sense of realism and immediacy.",

      "original_title": "The Shining",
      "overview": "The Shining, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is a masterful psychological horror film that has captivated audiences since its release in 1980. Based on Stephen King's novel, the story follows Jack Torrance, a struggling writer who accepts a job as the winter caretaker of the isolated Overlook Hotel. He brings along his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, who possesses a psychic gift known as 'the shining'. As winter sets in and they're cut off from the outside world, Jack's mental state begins to deteriorate, leading to disturbing events that blur the lines between reality and the supernatural. One reason to recommend The Shining is its unique approach to horror. Rather than relying on cheap scares or excessive gore, It builds tension through unsettling imagery, an ominous score, and meticulous cinematography. The hotel itself becomes a character, with its endless corridors and hauntingly empty spaces contributing to a growing sense of dread. Kubrick's attention to detail and his use of symmetry, color, and framing create a visually captivating experience that keeps audiences on edge. Watching Jack's descent into madness and the chilling effect it has on his family adds layers of psychological depth, making this horror story not just frightening but also intensely provoking.",

Because it inspired all the modern horror films and, at the same time, it generally stayed faithful to the original (1968). At the beginning, it shows the siblings Barbra and Johnny drive to a cemetery in rural Pennsylvania to visit their father's grave, where a pale man in a tattered suit kills Johnny and attacks Barbra. She flees to a nearby farmhouse but finds the resident's corpse lying half-eaten on the stairs. A growing horde of ghouls soon surround the house as a stranger, Ben, arrives and initially mistakes Barbra for the homeowner. After driving back several ghouls, he boards the windows and doors. Will they make it through the night?",

The film was premiered on 18 May 2009 at the Cannes Film Festival; moreover, it should be emphasized that on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 93% approval rating.
